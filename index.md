## Scope

We welcome contributions from academia, industry and governmental entities with interdisciplinary backgrounds to facilitate the growth of the new area of digital manufacturing.
The topics of interest to the workshop include but are not limited to:

* Security and privacy in digital manufacturing
* Additive manufacturing as a Cyber-physical system
* Reliability in manufacturing ecosystems
* Artificial intelligence for manufacturing
* Signal processing and robotics for manufacturing
* Technological barriers in digital manufacturing
* Network security for digital manufacturing
* Resilient manufacturing systems and cybersecurity
* Intrusion and anomaly detection
* Standards for digital manufacturing
* Human in the loop in digital manufacturing
* Resilience metrics for manufacturing
* Control-theoretic approaches in manufacturing
* Economics of future manufacturing technologies
* Hardware-assisted digital manufacturing
* Encryption and authentication for manufacturing
* Innovations in computer-aided design
* Safety concerns in future manufacturing
* Understanding barriers/enablers in modern manufacturing


Also, of interest will be contributions that can point the research community to new research directions, and those that can set research agendas and priorities in reliable and resilient digital manufacturing.

## Contributions Guidelines
Acceptable submissions include:
* Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) presentations, 
* Original research presentations, 
* Demos, and 
* Posters.

Top submissions will be invited to a special issue of IEEE Embedded System Letters (ESL) on Reliable and Resilient Digital Manufacturing.
